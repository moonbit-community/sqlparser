- [ ] **Partitioning** - Advanced table partitioning schemes  
- [ ] **File format support** - Parquet, ORC, Avro syntax
- [ ] **External tables** - External data source integration

## Implementation Notes

### Architecture Principles
- Maintain modular design with separate files for each feature area
- Follow existing patterns for AST definition, parsing, and pretty printing
- Ensure comprehensive test coverage for all new features
- Support multiple dialects where features overlap

### Development Guidelines
- Implement high-priority features first to maximize utility
- Consider backward compatibility with existing API
- Document dialect-specific behaviors clearly
- Include error handling and helpful error messages

### Testing Strategy
- Add both positive and negative test cases
- Test dialect-specific variations
- Verify pretty printing round-trip accuracy
- Include complex real-world query examples

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Major Features
1. **Window Functions** - Complete OVER clause support with partitioning, ordering, and frame specifications
2. **CREATE INDEX** - Comprehensive index creation with all standard options
3. **DROP INDEX** - Index removal with concurrency and existence checks
4. **CREATE DATABASE/SCHEMA** - Database and schema management with character sets
5. **CREATE FUNCTION/PROCEDURE** - User-defined functions and procedures with parameters
6. **CREATE SEQUENCE** - Sequence generators with all PostgreSQL-style options
7. **ALTER INDEX** - Index modification operations with RENAME TO, SET TABLESPACE, RESET, and SET parameter operations
8. **Advanced INSERT** - Enhanced conflict resolution with PostgreSQL ON CONFLICT support (DO NOTHING, DO UPDATE SET)
9. **MERGE Statements** - Advanced UPSERT operations for data synchronization
10. **USE Database** - Database switching for multi-database environments
11. **COPY Statements** - Comprehensive bulk data import/export operations with full PostgreSQL syntax support
12. **Parameterized Queries** - Prepared statement placeholders supporting multiple formats (?, $1, :name, @param) across all SQL dialects
